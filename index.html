									<h2 class="major">What is "data structures"?!</h2>
									<p align="justify">As pictures illustrate, We see Data structure all around us. we actually use its methods in our everyday life, at our jobs and houses to organize and store items.
									   Data structures enable us not only to store and organize our data, but also we have the possiblity to access and modify them efficiently. Arrays, Linked Lists, trees and Queues are covered here. A short description of each data structure is given at its relative section. A more in-depth explanation and code implementation approach is available at my GitHub page.

											<h3 class="major">1. Basic Array</h3>
											<p align = "justify">Arrays are mainly used because of their structure to store elements. First element 
											   has the base address. You can access each element of array using indexing. 
											   Different kind of arrays can be implemented from one dimensional to multidimensional
											   arrays. Arrays can also be static or dynamic. Arrays are used in implementation of lists, queues, heaps, hash tables for example.   
											</p>

											<div><a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/Queue.jpg" alt="" class="float_img"/></a></div>
											
											<h3 class="major">2. Queue</h3>
											<p align = "justify">Queue is much like what we understand as lining up. It is 
												a sequence of elements. New element can be added to back of the sequence (tail) and element
											can be removed from front of the sequence (head). The process of removing from the sequence
										follows FIFO ( first in first out).
											</p>

										<article>
											<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/Trees.jpg" alt="" class="float_img" /></a>
											<h3 class="major">3. Trees</h3>
											<p align = "justify">Trees are structured as linked nodes. The very first
												node of a tree is root node. Important terms are used in working with trees, but the most
												important ones are child nodes, parent nodes, sibling nodes. 
												A subtree can also be defined from a tree. Subtree is also a tree from the main tree,
												which consists of a node and all of desendants of that node. 
											</p>

										<article>
											<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/LinkedLists.jpg" alt="" class="float_img" /></a>
											<h3 class="major">4. Linked list</h3>
											<p align = "justify">In comparison to array, elements of a linked lists are not 
												structured based on their physical placement. The elements points to each other. Therefore it represents a sequence.
												Linked lists are for example used to implement queues, stacks, binary trees, hash table.
												Linked lists are categorized as : 
												<li>Single linked list</li>
												<li>Doubly linked list</li>
												<li>Multiply linked list</li>
												<li>Circular linked list</li>

							<p align = "justify">My journey as Software developer started from a couple of years ago, getting my hands dirty with programming robotics applications. 
							   Learning art and craft of software development is a lifetime agenda. I decided to work on this website to cover some essential topics, starting with data structure. 
							   My approach towards code implementations is also available in my GitHub page. 
							   Makes me more than happy to hear your comments and Feedback.
